# Planning

## What is your website about?

### Do you like dogs, New York, or Pac-man?

I think just for the sake of learning and efficency; I'm going to build a website about JavaScript.

## What Information are you presenting on the subject?

### Write a title and a few paragraphs and think of an image you'd like to show on your page

Title = "WTF is JavaScript?!"
Image = [[JavaScript-Logo.png]]

## What does your website look like?

### in simple high-level terms? What's the background color? What kind of font is appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle?

Goal: comfortable website that is easy on the eyes.

## Font

'inconsolata'

### Embeded code in the <head> of your html

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inconsolata:wght@200..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

### Inconsolata: CSS class for a variable style

```html
// <weight>: Use a value from 200 to 900
// <uniquifier>: Use a unique and descriptive class name

.inconsolata-<uniquifier> {
  font-family: "Inconsolata", monospace;
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
  font-weight: <weight>;
  font-style: normal;
  font-variation-settings:
    "wdth" 100;
}
```
